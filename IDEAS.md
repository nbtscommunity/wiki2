* Markdown for markup
* Allow HTML -- radical power for a wiki!
* Require logins
* Allow Pseudonyms
* Give tools to admins to purge terrible people from the repos, expunging their history and eliminating what they write -- goodbye spam.
* Look for ways to interact in different modes:
  * inline edits
  * replies to in-page threads
  * let as much of the code that controls a page be modified by editors as well
* the only thing that requires special access is mucking with history.
  * How do we make a resilient architecture in the face of edits to its own code?
